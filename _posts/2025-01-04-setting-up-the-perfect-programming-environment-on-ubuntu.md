Stepping into a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pharmacy felt like stepping back in time — drawers labeled with herbs I could barely pronounce, wooden counters worn smooth by generations of healers. As part of a summer internship at the **Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine**, I had the rare opportunity to explore this living tradition from the inside out.

*At the weighing station, learning how accuracy matters when preparing formulas.*

My main tasks were deceptively simple: locating the right herbs from hundreds of wooden drawers, measuring dosages using classic metal scales, and assisting pharmacists in preparing prescriptions for patients. But each task opened a window into centuries of accumulated knowledge — and responsibility. I quickly learned that one misplaced herb or an extra gram could affect the outcome of a treatment.

This wasn’t just about herbs. It was about **understanding the trust** people place in medicine — especially parents bringing herbal blends for their children, or elderly patients sharing stories while waiting for their prescriptions. I saw firsthand how traditional knowledge, when handled with care and humility, still thrives in a modern clinical setting.

Whether sorting through slices of *angelica root* or watching a pharmacist tailor a formula based on someone’s body type, I felt part of something larger — a legacy of healing, preserved not in books alone but in daily hands-on practice.

Modern healthcare and ancient practice aren’t mutually exclusive — they complement each other more than we imagine.

This experience taught me not only practical skills but also how to **observe, listen, and respect** systems of knowledge different from what I was used to. I hope to continue exploring how tradition and science can work hand in hand to make healthcare more holistic and human.
