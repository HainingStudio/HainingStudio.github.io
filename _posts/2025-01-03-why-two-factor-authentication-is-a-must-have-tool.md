In our herbal education project, hands-on learning plays a key role. Today, I’m sharing a short **guided video tour** filmed at the provincial hospital’s traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pharmacy, where I introduce several of the most common herbs used in daily prescriptions.

### Identifying and Describing Herbal Ingredients

In this video, I walk through the herb drawers and explain a handful of familiar names: **huangqi**, **renshen**, **shanyao**, **gouqi**, **chenpi**, and **ganjiang** — all of which we see often in classic TCM formulas.

{: .note }
This video is for **educational and illustrative purposes only**. Please consult licensed professionals for any medical decisions.

These herbs are all introduced using simplified, age-appropriate descriptions — a method we use when teaching kids about TCM without causing confusion or promoting unsupervised use.

> Slices, seeds, and peels — each herb has a shape and story worth knowing.

For example:
- **Huangqi (Astragalus)** — sliced; used to describe “supporting the body’s energy”
- **Renshen (Ginseng)** — sliced; introduced as “a root that boosts strength”
- **Shanyao (Chinese yam)** — sliced; explained as gentle support for digestion
- **Gouqi (Goji berries)** — red, familiar; presented as a “nourishing snack herb”
- **Chenpi (Dried tangerine peel)** — fragrant peel; tied to the “Qi flow” idea
- **Ganjiang (Dried ginger)** — slice form; used to illustrate “warming herbs”

Public understanding of Chinese herbs is often limited to packaging or brand names. But through this project, I want to **reconnect daily herbal practices with real textures, forms, and preparation steps** — especially for younger learners who might only see medicine as something hidden in bottles.

### Teaching Through Story and Practice

I filmed this video to complement my in-person storytelling sessions, where children are invited to guess which herbs are slices, fruits, or peels. They touch mock samples, draw their own “herb profile cards,” and sometimes write little “recipes” based on fictional patients (like “a panda with no energy” 🐼).

We always include **safety tips**, **avoid therapeutic claims**, and frame herbs as part of **culture and learning**, not treatment.
