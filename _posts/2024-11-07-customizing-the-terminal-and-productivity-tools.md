Stepping into the Hundred Herb Hall at the provincial TCM hospital is like opening a storybook made of drawers, smells, and slices. In this guided video, I introduce some of the most commonly used Chinese medicinal herbs — not just their names, but how we describe them to children in an engaging and respectful way.

### Behind the Drawers: A Video Walkthrough

This video is filmed in a real dispensary, where I show and explain herbs like **hawthorn (山楂)**, **six divine fermentation (六神曲)**, **white angelica (白芷)**, **true tangerine peel (真陈皮)**, and **pinellia (法半夏)**.

{: .note }
This walkthrough is designed for educational purposes only. It does not offer medical advice or treatment recommendations.

> We don’t just teach names. We teach meaning, method, and memory — through sight, sound, and story.

Each herb is introduced through its appearance, texture, preparation, and safe educational description:

- **Hawthorn (山楂)**: Slice form. Helps explain the concept of digestion and “body balance.”
- **Six Divine Fermentation (六神曲)**: A fermented herb with a unique scent, helpful for sensory learning.
- **White Angelica (白芷)**: Often used to relieve headaches — here described as a “wind-chasing root.”
- **True Tangerine Peel (真陈皮)**: A processed version of aged tangerine peel, tied to the concept of regulating Qi.
- **Pinellia (法半夏)**: Used to discuss preparation safety and the transformation of raw to usable forms.

To children, many of these items are new and unfamiliar. That’s why we combine the **visual**, the **tactile**, and the **narrative** — turning a list of plant names into a world of imagination and learning.

### Methods of Kid-Friendly Herb Education

In this project, we avoid complex medical terms and instead focus on **function-based metaphors**:

- Hawthorn becomes “a friendly fruit slice for the stomach”
- Angelica is “a root that clears cloudy thoughts”
- Tangerine peel is “a curl that helps Qi move smoothly”

{: .tip }
We always accompany these metaphors with clear safety rules: herbs are **not snacks**, and **never used without guidance**.
