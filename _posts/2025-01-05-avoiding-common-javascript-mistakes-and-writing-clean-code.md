As part of my herbal education project, I regularly visit my family's pharmacy to learn how herbs are stored, selected, and prepared. This hands-on experience helps me understand not only the medicinal properties of herbs, but also the care and precision needed to prepare them safely for others.

My work involves everything from recognizing raw herbs to weighing exact dosages using traditional Chinese scales. I take part in real dispensing sessions, shadow licensed pharmacists, and document the process to help kids and teens better understand Chinese medicine through visual storytelling.

*Learning to balance precision and speed when measuring sliced root herbs for a prescription.*

Each herb has its own storage box, label, and handling method. Some are used for clearing heat, others for warming the body — and understanding these categories makes me appreciate the logic behind TCM.

The pharmacy is both a workspace and a classroom. I take photos, log data, and ask questions while working. This work is not just practice — it's also a way of collecting stories that I turn into educational content for the project website.

Through these moments, I hope to build a bridge between ancient knowledge and modern understanding. Sharing these steps helps demystify Chinese medicine and brings it closer to curious young minds.

Learning to code is a journey, and consistent practice is essential. Building simple projects, solving problems, and collaborating with other learners are effective ways to progress. It’s normal to feel challenged at times, but every obstacle helps you grow as a developer. Enjoy the process, and don't be afraid to experiment with code!
