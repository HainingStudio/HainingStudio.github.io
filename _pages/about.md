Hi, I’m Haining 👋  
A student, herbal storyteller, and curious learner with a mission to make traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) more accessible to young minds.

## My Journey: From Pharmacy Drawers to Digital Platforms

I grew up around the scents, textures, and quiet rhythms of a traditional Chinese pharmacy. My parents worked in the dispensary of a provincial hospital, and from a young age, I was fascinated by the wooden drawers filled with unfamiliar names and earthy smells. Each herb had a story. Each formula carried a memory. But I also realized that many children—my peers included—found this world confusing, mysterious, or simply invisible.

This project began not as a plan, but as a response. A response to the curiosity I saw in younger kids who visited the pharmacy with their grandparents. A response to the lack of visual, child-friendly resources about Chinese herbal culture. And a response to the disconnect between generations when it came to understanding health, tradition, and science.

## What This Project Is — And Isn’t

This site is a **bilingual, multimedia resource** designed to introduce children and families to Chinese herbal medicine through **stories, videos, illustrations, and interactive data**.

It’s not a textbook.  
It’s not a medical guide.  
And it’s definitely not a place for miracle claims.

Instead, it’s a sandbox of learning — a place where questions are encouraged, mistakes are part of the process, and ancient knowledge meets modern methods.

## What I Believe

I believe in curiosity.  
I believe in learning by doing.  
I believe that even five-year-olds deserve honest, clear, and beautiful explanations of the world around them.

I also believe that tradition doesn’t have to mean stagnation. Chinese medicine is centuries old, but that doesn’t mean it belongs only in dusty books or hospital shelves. It can live in stories, in classrooms, in short videos and colorful charts — if we’re willing to reimagine it.

## How I Work

I design every part of this project with three principles in mind:

  1. Child-Friendly First  
All content is crafted to be safe, accessible, and interesting for young readers. I use simple metaphors, warm visuals, and avoid overwhelming medical jargon.

  2. Grounded in Science
I respect traditional practices, but I also believe in evidence, transparency, and critical thinking. That’s why I always mark safety tips, clarify what we *don’t* know, and avoid making health promises.

  3. Made with Data  
Where possible, I use surveys, classroom logs, and visualizations to track how children respond to different herbs, themes, and lessons. I believe learning can (and should) be measurable in joyful ways.

## What I’ve Done So Far

- Interned at the **Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine**, learning herb classification and real-world dispensing techniques
- Shadowed pharmacists and created photo logs of herb preparation and labeling
- Designed bilingual **Herb Profile** templates for use in primary school activities
- Built a survey to track **children’s recognition of common herbs** before and after storytelling sessions
- Produced vlog episodes where I walk kids through real herbal drawers and explain the use of a single plant, step by step
- Developed this Jekyll-powered website as both a personal archive and a public resource

## What’s Next

I plan to keep updating this platform with:

- **More herbal profiles**, including seasonal ingredients and region-specific plants  
- **Data stories**, visualizing things like “Which herbs do kids remember best?” or “What do children think herbs taste like?”
- **Guest features**, where I interview pharmacists, teachers, and other young learners about their views on tradition and health
- **Offline workshops**, in collaboration with schools and community centers

This isn’t just a school project — it’s a long-term journey I want to continue through high school, college, and beyond.

## Ethics & Safety Statement

All content on this website is for **educational purposes only**.  
It is **not medical advice**, and nothing here should replace professional consultation.

I take ethics seriously. That means:
- Avoiding exaggerated claims  
- Being transparent about sources  
- Respecting cultural context without romanticizing it  
- Prioritizing safety, consent, and child-appropriate language

## Thank You 🌿

If you’ve read this far, thank you.

You’re now part of a growing circle of people who believe that tradition and technology don’t have to live in separate worlds. That children can understand complex ideas if we trust them. And that learning about herbal medicine can be as joyful as it is respectful.

Let’s keep learning together.
